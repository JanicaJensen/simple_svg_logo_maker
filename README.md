## Team

---

The app was created by Janica Jensen.

_Other tools utilized:_

Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en

npm Inquirer.js: https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer

Jestjs: https://jestjs.io/

## Installation

---

To run this program, one should have Node.js version 16 installed as well as node package manager (npm) Inquirer, as the app does consider it "required". If one wishes to run the tests, they may also need Jestjs. In order to run all of the aforementioned, each respective file must be opened in integrated terminal and "npm i" run in order to install all dependencies. One should assure themselves that they are in the directory that requires a README, open an integrated terminal, invoke Node, and run the program with "node index.js".

## Usage

---

Once one has followed the installation guidelines above, they will be able to run the program in the integrated terminal using "node index.js". It will present the user with a question that should be answered with 3 characters for the text, a color or hexadecimal color for the colors and then choose a shape from the list. It will continue to present the user with questions which they must then answer, hit return, and answer the next until it runs out. There is one multiple choice question which requires the use of an arrow key to select. Once all questions have been answered, the last "return" will show the file as "Generated logo.svg" and the user will be able to see the logo.svg listed in the folder to the left where they populated it.

## Tests

---

This app can run a test that checks whether the shapes render correctly. It's pretty simple, but it will check to see if they generate the correct shapes, in black, with pink letters 'NNN' on them.To utilize the tests and run them, install Jest on the shapes.test.js and run it in integrated terminal with "jest shapes.test.js".
